# Brother-PT-PC-Driver
Python Driver for Brother P-Touch PC Pro Label Printer that communicates via an RS-232 serial port. I couldn't find any modern software to drive this label maker so I decided to make my own, it prints out 'bitmap.bmp' onto the label. Ideally want to use a bitmap of height 120 pixels
